-About Audio Loop

Most of tracks are repeatable without change.

Some tracks have two sections; separated to 'intro' section and 'loop' section.
If track has intro section, there is the same name with '_intro' track.

e.g.
If file 'foo' has intro, you will find 'foo_intro', next to 'foo'.

The intro section is not repeatable, but you can joint to the repeatble loop section.
